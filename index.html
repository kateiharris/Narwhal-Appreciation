      than 10 million nerve endings!</li>
      <li>Narwhals live in the freezing Arctic area around Greenland,
       Russia, Norway, and Canada.</li>
       <li>The word 'Narwhal' comes from the Norse 'corpse whale',
      in reference to the pale skin of the animal, making it look
      like a drowned human being.</li>
